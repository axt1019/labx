The project leverages local Cuyahoga food pantries as community spaces to connect with individuals who use tobacco and link them to this evidence-based cessation resource. As a research assistant, I have contributed by coding focus group transcripts, analyzing data, and running computer-based models to predict the impact of the pantry-based interventions."

    "text": "My academic journey began at Penn State, where I earned my B.S. in General Biology. Early on, I was honored to receive the Doris N. McKinstry Scholarship, a full-tuition award recognizing academic excellence. College was also a time of exploration and community. I was a part of various student orgs, including Black Caucus, Caribbean Student Association, and MAPS (Minority Association of Pre-Health Students). I also gained hands-on healthcare experience as a clinic intern at Penn State’s University Health Services, where I learned the value of patient-centered care and the real-world impacts of health inequities.\nHowever, one of the most important keys I unlocked was the power of the pivot. During my junior year, I was selected as a Ronald E. McNair Scholar, which connected me to a network of mentors and opportunities in research. That summer, I made my most important pivot, shifting from a path toward PA school to pursuing research for the very first time.\nToday, as a first-year PhD student in Epidemiology & Biostatistics at Case Western Reserve University, I continue to be guided by the lessons, experiences, and communities that have shaped my journey."

    "text": "LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n\n\n\n\nWelcome to my website!\nI’m Avianna Thompson, a first-year PhD student in Epidemiology & Biostatistics at Case Western Reserve University, passionate about using data, community partnerships, and research to advance food security, nutritional equity, and health justice.\nMy work centers on the complex systems that shape people’s ability to live healthy lives—particularly in marginalized communities. I’m especially interested in questions that sit at the intersection of public health, policy, and social justice. Whether it’s understanding how food insecurity impacts smoking behavior or mapping the structural factors that limit access to nutritious food, I’m driven by research that leads to meaningful, community-rooted change.\nI’m currently involved in several qualitative, systems-science, and community-based research projects, including an NIH-funded study implementing tobacco cessation strategies in food pantries. Through these experiences, I’ve learned data analysis, qualitative coding, and systems modeling—all with a focus on equity.\nMentorship and community-building are also important to me. From my time as a McNair Scholar at Penn State to my post-baccalaureate training as a CasePREP Scholar, I’ve learned the power of creating supportive pathways for underrepresented students in STEM. I’m committed to carrying that forward throughout my career.\nOn this website, you’ll find a selection of my publications, current research, along with updates on graduate school journey. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to connect!"
